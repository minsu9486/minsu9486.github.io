Hi! I’m Minsu, a curious software engineer who is always crawling on the programming world to satisfy my curiosity. The hunger for new knowledge has been my fuel to keep on working hard since I first said hello to the world.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
  
I have touched various area such as tools, UI, engine, graphics, VR, and even network. I always want to experience varied environments. This mindset allows me to keep pursuing various skills and being creative. I hope one day I can be a person who can seek harmony in technical  discord.
