![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/200x200 Circle.png){: .align-left} Hi! I’m Minsu, a curious game programmer who is always crawling on the programming world to satisfy my curiosity. The hunger for new knowledge has been my fuel to keep on working hard since I first said hello to the world. Although I have over 2 years of professional experience in IT industry, I'm currently a full-time student in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation at Digipen. I'd really wondered about the authentic life of a game developer in the real industry during my college life. So I postponed my studies and began to work at a small mobile gaming company as a client-side programmer and completed my military service at Republic of Korea Cyber Command as a Network Security Analyst.
