Hi! I’m Minsu, a curious software engineer who is always crawling on the programming world to satisfy my curiosity. The hunger for new knowledge has been my fuel to keep on working hard since I first said hello to the world.

Although I have over 2 years of professional experience in IT industry, I'm currently a full-time student in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation at Digipen. During my college life with loads of assignments, I was really wondering about the authentic life of a game developer in the real industry. So I postponed my studies and began to work at a small mobile gaming company as a client-side programmer. In the next year, I answered the call of duty from my country and completed my military service at Republic of Korea Cyber Command as a Network Security Analyst.

And... Here I am, BACK TO SCHOOL, to strengthen my fundamental knowledge on computer science!
