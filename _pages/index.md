    excerpt: "Hi! I’m Minsu, a curious game programmer who is always crawling on the programming world to satisfy my curiosity about all technoloy of game devlopment. The hunger for new knowledge have been my fuel to keep on working hard since I first said hello to the world. Although I have over 2 years of professional experience in IT field, I'm currently a full-time student in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation at Digipen. I'd really wondered about the authentic life of a game developer in the real industry during my college life. So I postponed my studies and began to work at a small mobile gaming company as a client-side programmer and completed my military service at Republic of Korea Cyber Command as a Network Security Analyst."
